# Valid Protocol - A Blockchain Solution to Fake News (Encode Hackathon)

In this project, we propose a decentralized, blockchain-based solution to the hazards presented by the propagation of Fake News.

## Introduction 

The massive adoption of social media and distributed communication has provided an unprecedented load of information, where the sheer mass of data is behemothic - to the point where it has become almost impossible to provide the necessaty context for every single bit transmitted to the general public.

Multiple solutions have been thrown around through the heated debate pool, such as the use of censorship and force to supress misinformation
